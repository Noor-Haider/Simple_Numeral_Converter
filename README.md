# Simple Numeral Converter

---

This application is a numeral converter that can convert both Roman and Arabic numerals. 
It can detect which numeral type has been inputted and perform conversion accordingly.

The application can convert numbers up to **3,999**, which is the limit of the Roman numerals.
Attempting to convert numbers larger than this or inputting illegal characters will yield an
*Invalid Input* error.

I initiated this project to practice Object-Oriented Programming as well as to familiarize
myself with GUI development in Python. I used the PyQt5 library for GUI development, and the Qt designer for GUI design.
Formulating the necessary algorithms to perform the conversions was also very fun and challenging.
